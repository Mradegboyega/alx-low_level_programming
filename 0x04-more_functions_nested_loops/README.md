# Problem Solving with C

This repository contains solutions to various C programming problems, including exercises and challenges. Each problem is solved within a single C file, and you can find the corresponding descriptions below.

## List of Solved Problems

### Problem 0: Check for Uppercase Character

**Description**: Write a C function `_isupper` that checks if a character is uppercase. The function returns 1 if the character is uppercase and 0 otherwise.

**Prototype**: `int _isupper(int c);`

### Problem 1: Check for Digit

**Description**: Write a C function `_isdigit` that checks if a character is a digit (0 through 9). The function returns 1 if the character is a digit and 0 otherwise.

**Prototype**: `int _isdigit(int c);`

### Problem 2: Multiply Two Integers

**Description**: Write a C function `mul` that multiplies two integers and returns the result.

**Prototype**: `int mul(int a, int b);`

### Problem 3: Print Numbers

**Description**: Write a C function `print_numbers` that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 followed by a new line. You can only use the `_putchar` function twice in your code.

**Prototype**: `void print_numbers(void);`

### Problem 4: Print Most Numbers

**Description**: Write a C function `print_most_numbers` that prints the numbers from 0 to 9 followed by a new line. Do not print 2 and 4. You can only use the `_putchar` function twice in your code.

**Prototype**: `void print_most_numbers(void);`

### Problem 5: Print More Numbers

**Description**: Write a C function `more_numbers` that prints 10 times the numbers from 0 to 14 followed by a new line. You can only use the `_putchar` function three times in your code.

**Prototype**: `void more_numbers(void);`

### Problem 6: Print a Line

**Description**: Write a C function `print_line` that draws a straight line in the terminal using the `_putchar` function. The number of times the character `_` is printed is given as input, and the line should end with a newline character. If the input is 0 or less, the function should only print a newline.

**Prototype**: `void print_line(int n);`

### Problem 7: Print a Diagonal Line

**Description**: Write a C function `print_diagonal` that draws a diagonal line in the terminal using the `_putchar` function. The number of times the character `\` is printed is given as input, and the diagonal should end with a newline character. If the input is 0 or less, the function should only print a newline.

**Prototype**: `void print_diagonal(int n);`

### Problem 8: Print a Square

**Description**: Write a C function `print_square` that prints a square followed by a new line using the `_putchar` function. The size of the square is given as input, and if the size is 0 or less, the function should print only a newline. Use the character `#` to print the square.

**Prototype**: `void print_square(int size);`

### Problem 9: Fizz-Buzz

**Description**: Write a C program that prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz," multiples of 5 with "Buzz," and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz." Each number or word should be separated by a space.

### Problem 10: Print a Triangle

**Description**: Write a C function `print_triangle` that prints a triangle of `#` characters. The size of the triangle is given as input, and if the size is 0 or less, the function should print only a newline. Use the character `#` to print the triangle.

**Prototype**: `void print_triangle(int size);`

### Problem 11: Find Largest Prime Factor

**Description**: Write a C program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line. You are allowed to use the standard library.

### Problem 12: Print an Integer

**Description**: Write a C function `print_number` that prints an integer using the `_putchar` function. You are not allowed to use long, arrays, or pointers, and you should not hard-code special values.
