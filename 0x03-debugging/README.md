# Debugging Project

## Overview

This project is a part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and focuses on debugging C code. Debugging is the process of identifying and fixing errors or bugs in a program's source code. In this project, I work with existing C code files that have bugs, and the goal is to identify and fix these issues to make the programs run correctly.

## Project Structure

The project consists of multiple C source code files, each representing a different debugging task. Each task presents a specific issue in the code that needs to be resolved to produce the correct output. The tasks involve a variety of debugging scenarios, such as fixing logic errors, handling edge cases, and ensuring code adheres to specific standards.

## Compilation and Testing

To compile the code for each task, use the provided compilation commands. These commands include necessary compiler flags and options to ensure the code is compiled correctly. After compilation, you can run the resulting executable to test the code and verify that the issues have been resolved.

## Task Descriptions

1. **0-main.c**: Testing a function that determines if an integer is positive, negative, or zero. The task involves creating a test case where the input is 0.

2. **1-main.c**: Identifying and commenting out code that causes an infinite loop in a program.

3. **2-largest_number.c**: Fixing a function that finds the largest of three integers. The task involves ensuring the function returns the correct result.

4. **3-convert_day.c** and **3-print_remaining_days.c**: Modifying code to convert a date to the day of the year and calculate the remaining days in the year, considering leap years. The task involves handling various date scenarios and edge cases.

## Documentation

Each task may include comments and explanations within the source code to describe the issues and solutions applied during debugging. The code is also formatted according to the Betty style guide.
