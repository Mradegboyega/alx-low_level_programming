# README for Tasks

This README provides an overview of six tasks, each with a brief description of its purpose and functionality:

## Task 0: Print Name

- **Description:** This task involves writing a program that prints its own name.
- **Requirements:** The program should be Betty compliant, with no errors or warnings.
- **Functionality:** When executed, the program prints its own filename.

## Task 1: Print Arguments Count

- **Description:** In this task, you need to create a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it.
- **Requirements:** The program should be Betty compliant, with no errors or warnings.
- **Functionality:** When executed, the program prints the count of command-line arguments it receives.

## Task 2: Print Arguments

- **Description:** This task requires you to develop a program that prints all the arguments it receives, including the first argument (the program name).
- **Requirements:** The program should be Betty compliant, with no more than five functions per file, and prototypes should be included in main.h.
- **Functionality:** When executed, the program prints each command-line argument on a separate line.

## Task 3: Multiply Two Numbers

- **Description:** In this task, you are tasked with creating a program that multiplies two numbers.
- **Requirements:** The program should be Betty compliant, with no more than five functions per file, and prototypes should be included in main.h.
- **Functionality:** When executed with two numerical arguments, the program prints the result of multiplying those two numbers. If it doesn't receive exactly two arguments, it prints an error message.

## Task 4: Add Positive Numbers

- **Description:** Task 4 involves writing a program that adds positive numbers passed as command-line arguments.
- **Requirements:** The program should be Betty compliant, with no more than five functions per file, and prototypes should be included in main.h.
- **Functionality:** When executed, the program adds all positive numerical arguments and prints the result. If it encounters a non-positive number or no arguments, it prints an error message.

## Task 5: Minimum Number of Coins for Change

- **Description:** For this task, you need to create a program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to make change for a given amount.
- **Requirements:** The program should be Betty compliant, with no errors or warnings.
- **Functionality:** When executed with a positive number as an argument, the program calculates and prints the minimum number of coins (using denominations 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent) required to make that amount of change. If the argument is not a positive number, it prints "0."

These descriptions provide an overview of each task's purpose and expected behavior.
