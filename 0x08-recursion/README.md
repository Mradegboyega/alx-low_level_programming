# Recursion in C

This repository contains a collection of C programs that demonstrate the use of recursion. Each program focuses on a specific recursion-related task. The code is written in compliance with the Betty style guide.

## Task 1: Printing a String Recursively

### File: `0-puts_recursion.c`

This program defines a function `_puts_recursion` that prints a string followed by a new line using recursion. The function uses the Betty style guide.

## Task 2: Printing a String in Reverse

### File: `1-print_rev_recursion.c`

In this task, we have implemented a function `_print_rev_recursion` that prints a string in reverse using recursion. The code adheres to the Betty style guide.

## Task 3: Finding the Length of a String Recursively

### File: `2-strlen_recursion.c`

The program in this task calculates the length of a string recursively and defines the function `_strlen_recursion`. The code follows the Betty style guide.

## Task 4: Computing the Factorial of a Number

### File: `3-factorial.c`

This program computes the factorial of a given number using recursion. The `factorial` function returns -1 for negative inputs and considers the factorial of 0 to be 1. The code is Betty compliant.

## Task 5: Computing the Power of a Number

### File: `4-pow_recursion.c`

In this task, we have implemented a function `_pow_recursion` that calculates the value of `x` raised to the power of `y`. The function returns -1 if `y` is negative. The code follows the Betty style guide.

## Task 6: Finding the Square Root of a Number

### File: `5-sqrt_recursion.c`

This program defines a function `_sqrt_recursion` that computes the natural square root of a number. It returns -1 if the number does not have a natural square root. The code is Betty compliant.

## Task 7: Checking for Prime Numbers

### File: `6-is_prime_number.c`

In this task, we have created a function `is_prime_number` to check if an integer is a prime number. The code returns 1 for prime numbers and 0 for non-prime numbers. It follows the Betty style guide.

## Task 8: Checking for Palindromes

### File: `7-is_palindrome.c`

The program defines a function `is_palindrome` that checks if a given string is a palindrome. The code handles strings with special character '*' as a wildcard. It adheres to the Betty style guide.
