This README provides an overview of the problems and tasks completed during today's problem-solving session.

## Problem 1: Writing Betty-Compliant Functions

In this task, I wrote several C functions, ensuring they followed the Betty style guidelines. Each function had specific requirements, including prototypes, documentation, and coding style. The functions I implemented include:

1. `_memset`: Fills memory with a constant byte.
2. `_memcpy`: Copies memory area.
3. `_strchr`: Locates a character in a string.
4. `_strspn`: Gets the length of a prefix substring.
5. `_strpbrk`: Searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
6. `_strstr`: Locates a substring in a string.
7. `print_chessboard`: Prints a chessboard.
8. `print_diagsums`: Prints the sum of the diagonals of a square matrix.
9. `set_string`: Sets the value of a pointer to a char.

Each function was documented and formatted according to the specified requirements.

## Problem 2: Cracking a Password (crackme2)

In this task,I attempted to find the password required to access the `crackme2` executable. I used various tools and techniques as instructed, including:

- `ltrace`: To trace library calls.
- `ldd`: To list dynamic dependencies.
- `gdb`: For debugging and analyzing the program.
- `objdump`: To disassemble the executable.
- Installation of the `libssl-dev` library.
- Editing the `sources.list` file to install `libssl1.0.0`.
