# C Programming Tasks README

This README provides an overview of the C programming tasks completed with detailed explanations.

## Task 1: Binary to Unsigned Int

### Description
- The `binary_to_uint` function converts a binary number represented as a string to an unsigned int.
- The input string should consist of '0' and '1' characters only.
- Returns the converted number, or 0 if there are invalid characters or if the input is NULL.

### Files
- `main.h`: Contains function prototypes and includes the `_putchar` prototype.
- `1-binary_to_uint.c`: The implementation of the `binary_to_uint` function.

## Task 2: Printing Binary

### Description
- The `print_binary` function prints the binary representation of a number.
- The function uses bitwise operations to print the binary representation.
- The format of the output is as shown in the example.

### Files
- `main.h`: Contains function prototypes and includes the `_putchar` prototype.
- `2-print_binary.c`: The implementation of the `print_binary` function.

## Task 3: Setting a Bit to 1

### Description
- The `set_bit` function sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
- The function modifies the original number by setting the specified bit to 1.

### Files
- `main.h`: Contains function prototypes.
- `3-set_bit.c`: The implementation of the `set_bit` function.

## Task 4: Clearing a Bit to 0

### Description
- The `clear_bit` function sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
- The function modifies the original number by clearing the specified bit to 0.

### Files
- `main.h`: Contains function prototypes.
- `4-clear_bit.c`: The implementation of the `clear_bit` function.

## Task 5: Flipping Bits

### Description
- The `flip_bits` function calculates the number of bits to flip to get from one number to another.
- It uses XOR and bitwise operations to count the differing bits.

### Files
- `main.h`: Contains function prototypes.
- `5-flip_bits.c`: The implementation of the `flip_bits` function.

## Task 6: Endianness Checker

### Description
- The `get_endianness` function checks the endianness of the system (big-endian or little-endian).
- It uses a bitwise operation to determine the endianness.

### Files
- `main.h`: Contains the function prototype.
- `6-get_endianness.c`: The implementation of the `get_endianness` function.
